# thermald
The thermald daemon prevents machines from overheating. It monitors thermal sensors and will modify cooling controls to keep the hardware cool. Thermald uses the available CPU temperature sensors and will keep the CPU from overheating. If hardware supplies a skin temperature sensor then by default thermald will endeavour to keep the skin temperature under 45 degrees C.
